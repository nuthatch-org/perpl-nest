-- Perpl on Monad (nuthatch-org/nuthatch#1148): the venue's data in the units people use.
--
-- Every on-chain amount is a fixed-point integer with a per-market or per-exchange scale. The scales
-- are on chain too: `priceDecimals` and `lotDecimals` arrive with each market in `ContractAddedV2`
-- (`ContractAdded` for the earliest), and the collateral token AUSD has 6 decimals
-- (`ExchangeInitialized.collateralDecimals`, and the public context at app.perpl.xyz/api/v1/pub/context
-- agrees: BTC price 1 / size 5, ETH 2 / 3, SOL 3 / 3, MON 6 / 0, HYPE 4 / 2, ZEC 2 / 4, LIT 5 / 1,
-- PUMP 6 / 0, checked 2026-09-04). Rates - fees and funding - are parts per hundred thousand of
-- one, i.e. fractions scaled by 10^5 (`FEE_SCALE` and `FUNDING_RATE_SCALE` are both 5 in dex-sdk
-- crates/sdk/src/num.rs and state/perpetual.rs at commit 65e0e897da), so percent is the value
-- divided by 1,000. Perpl's public API reports the same rate in millionths, ten times the on-chain
-- integer; parity confirmed that on BTC (on-chain -50, API -500).
--
-- Suffix key, from the ABI: CNS = collateral (AUSD, 6 dp), PNS = price (market decimals),
-- LNS = lot/size (market decimals), Hdths = hundredths, Per100K = parts per 100,000.

-- One row per market, the latest definition winning. Both event versions are unioned so the earliest
-- markets, defined before the V2 event existed, are not missing from every join below.
